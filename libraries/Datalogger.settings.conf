# This is the global settings file for the datalogger.
# Any lines that start with a '#' are comments.
# A comment must be on its own line.

# Each setting is a setting name, followed by an equals sign, followed by the setting value.
# The setting name is case-sensitive, e.g. GPRS_APN is a value name, but gprs_apn is not.

# There can be whitespace between the '=' sign and the name/value.
# e.g. GPRS_APN=giffgaff.com and GPRS_APN = giffgaff.com are equally valid.
